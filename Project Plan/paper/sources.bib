	abstract = {Being able to build a map of the environment and to simultaneously localize within this map is an essential skill for mobile robots navigating in unknown environments in absence of external referencing systems such as {GPS}. This so-called simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) problem has been one of the most popular research topics in mobile robotics for the last two decades and efﬁcient approaches for solving this task have been proposed. One intuitive way of formulating {SLAM} is to use a graph whose nodes correspond to the poses of the robot at different points in time and whose edges represent constraints between the poses. The latter are obtained from observations of the environment or from movement actions carried out by the robot. Once such a graph is constructed, the map can be computed by ﬁnding the spatial conﬁguration of the nodes that is mostly consistent with the measurements modeled by the edges. In this paper, we provide an introductory description to the graph-based {SLAM} problem. Furthermore, we discuss a state-of-the-art solution that is based on least-squares error minimization and exploits the structure of the {SLAM} problems during optimization. The goal of this tutorial is to enable the reader to implement the proposed methods from scratch.},

	abstract={Recent work has shown the feasibility of pedestrian and robotic indoor localization based only on maps of the magnetic field. To obtain a complete representation of the magnetic field without initial knowledge of the environment or any existing infrastructure, we consider an autonomous robotic platform to reduce limitations of economic or operational feasibility. Therefore, we present a novel robotic system that autonomously samples any measurable physical processes at high spatial resolution in buildings without any prior knowledge of the buildings' structure. In particular we focus on adaptable robotic shapes, kinematics and sensor placements to both achieve complete coverage in hardly accessible areas and not be limited to round shaped robots. We propose a grid based representation of the robot's configuration space and graph search algorithms, such as Best-First-Search and an adaption of Dijkstra's algorithm, to guarantee complete path coverage. In combination with an optical simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, we present experimental results by sampling the magnetic field in an a priori unknown office with a robotic platform autonomously and completely.},

Also, to enable data association in real-time, we provide efﬁcient algorithms to access the estimation uncertainties of interest based on the factored information matrix.

We build local maps using three-dimensional hexagonal block tiling. To make our approach computationally tractable we use reduced-rank Gaussian process regression in combination with a Rao–Blackwellised particle ﬁlter. We show that it is possible to obtain accurate position and orientation estimates using measurements from a smartphone, and that our approach provides a scalable magnetic ﬁeld {SLAM} algorithm in terms of both computational complexity and map storage.},

In order for robot localization and mapping in unknown area, simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) technique is applied to map the surrounding area. In this case, when {SLAM} is performed using a ﬁeld such as {WiFi}, magnetic signal or terrain, a complete ﬁeld map should be inferred for the unexplored region as well as the explored one. Also the uncertainty should be indicated for the inferred ﬁeld, so that the ﬁeld map can be used as observation model for {SLAM}. Therefore, by modeling the observation model for the terrain ﬁeld with the Gaussian process, we estimate the observation probability distribution for the unknown regions. The inferred observation distribution can be used not only by ﬁeld maps, but also by efﬁcient path planning. We demonstrate the proposed method with the odometry of mobile robot navigating the testbed, and observations of terrain feature using simulation.},

	abstract = {The Gaussian process latent variable model ({GP}-{LVM}) provides a ﬂexible approach for non-linear dimensionality reduction that has been widely applied. However, the current approach for training {GP}-{LVMs} is based on maximum likelihood, where the latent projection variables are maximized over rather than integrated out. In this paper we present a Bayesian method for training {GP}-{LVMs} by introducing a non-standard variational inference framework that allows to approximately integrate out the latent variables and subsequently train a {GP}-{LVM} by maximizing an analytic lower bound on the exact marginal likelihood. We apply this method for learning a {GP}-{LVM} from iid observations and for learning non-linear dynamical systems where the observations are temporally correlated. We show that a beneﬁt of the variational Bayesian procedure is its robustness to overﬁtting and its ability to automatically select the dimensionality of the nonlinear latent space. The resulting framework is generic, ﬂexible and easy to extend for other purposes, such as Gaussian process regression with uncertain inputs and semi-supervised Gaussian processes. We demonstrate our method on synthetic data and standard machine learning benchmarks, as well as challenging real world datasets, including high resolution video data.},

abstract={An algorithm is presented that enables devices equipped with microphones, such as robots, to move within their environment in order to explore, adapt to, and interact with sound sources of interest. Acoustic scene mapping creates a three-dimensional (3D) representation of the positional information of sound sources across time and space. In practice, positional source information is only provided by Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) estimates of the source directions; the source-sensor range is typically difficult to obtain. DoA estimates are also adversely affected by reverberation, noise, and interference, leading to errors in source location estimation and consequent false DoA estimates. Moreover, many acoustic sources, such as human talkers, are not continuously active, such that periods of inactivity lead to missing DoA estimates. Withal, the DoA estimates are specified relative to the observer's sensor location and orientation. Accurate positional information about the observer therefore is crucial. This paper proposes Acoustic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (aSLAM), which uses acoustic signals to simultaneously map the 3D positions of multiple sound sources while passively localizing the observer within the scene map. The performance of aSLAM is analyzed and evaluated using a series of realistic simulations. Results are presented to show the impact of the observer motion and sound source localization accuracy.},

abstract={Acoustic scene mapping creates a representation of positions of audio sources such as talkers within the surrounding environment of a microphone array. By allowing the array to move, the acoustic scene can be explored in order to improve the map. Furthermore, the spatial diversity of the kinematic array allows for estimation of the source-sensor distance in scenarios where source directions of arrival are measured. As sound source localization is performed relative to the array position, mapping of acoustic sources requires knowledge of the absolute position of the microphone array in the room. If the array is moving, its absolute position is unknown in practice. Hence, Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is required in order to localize the microphone array position and map the surrounding sound sources. In realistic environments, microphone arrays receive a convolutive mixture of direct-path speech signals, noise and reflections due to reverberation. A key challenge of Acoustic SLAM (a-SLAM) is robustness against reverberant clutter measurements and missing source detections. This paper proposes a novel bearing-only a-SLAM approach using a Single-Cluster Probability Hypothesis Density filter. Results demonstrate convergence to accurate estimates of the array trajectory and source positions.},

In this paper, we show that such an assumption is not essential; echoes provide sufficient clues to reconstruct the room's and the array's geometries jointly, even from a single acoustic event. Rather than focusing on the combinatorial problem of matching the walls and the recorded echoes, we provide algorithms for solving the joint estimation problem in practical cases when this matching is known and the number of microphones is small. We then explore intriguing connections between this problem and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and show that SLAM can be solved by the same methods.
