	abstract = {Being able to build a map of the environment and to simultaneously localize within this map is an essential skill for mobile robots navigating in unknown environments in absence of external referencing systems such as {GPS}. This so-called simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) problem has been one of the most popular research topics in mobile robotics for the last two decades and efﬁcient approaches for solving this task have been proposed. One intuitive way of formulating {SLAM} is to use a graph whose nodes correspond to the poses of the robot at different points in time and whose edges represent constraints between the poses. The latter are obtained from observations of the environment or from movement actions carried out by the robot. Once such a graph is constructed, the map can be computed by ﬁnding the spatial conﬁguration of the nodes that is mostly consistent with the measurements modeled by the edges. In this paper, we provide an introductory description to the graph-based {SLAM} problem. Furthermore, we discuss a state-of-the-art solution that is based on least-squares error minimization and exploits the structure of the {SLAM} problems during optimization. The goal of this tutorial is to enable the reader to implement the proposed methods from scratch.},

	abstract={Recent work has shown the feasibility of pedestrian and robotic indoor localization based only on maps of the magnetic field. To obtain a complete representation of the magnetic field without initial knowledge of the environment or any existing infrastructure, we consider an autonomous robotic platform to reduce limitations of economic or operational feasibility. Therefore, we present a novel robotic system that autonomously samples any measurable physical processes at high spatial resolution in buildings without any prior knowledge of the buildings' structure. In particular we focus on adaptable robotic shapes, kinematics and sensor placements to both achieve complete coverage in hardly accessible areas and not be limited to round shaped robots. We propose a grid based representation of the robot's configuration space and graph search algorithms, such as Best-First-Search and an adaption of Dijkstra's algorithm, to guarantee complete path coverage. In combination with an optical simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, we present experimental results by sampling the magnetic field in an a priori unknown office with a robotic platform autonomously and completely.},

Also, to enable data association in real-time, we provide efﬁcient algorithms to access the estimation uncertainties of interest based on the factored information matrix. We systematically evaluate the different components of {iSAM} as well as the overall algorithm using various simulated and real-world datasets for both landmark and pose-only settings.},

If data can be processed sequentially, the recursive regression method proposed in this paper allows incorporating new data with constant computation time. For this purpose two operations are performed alternating on a ﬁxed set of so-called basis vectors used for estimating the latent function: First, inference of the latent function at the new inputs. Second, utilization of the new data for updating the estimate. Numerical simulations show that the proposed approach signiﬁcantly reduces the computation time and at the same time provides more accurate estimates compared to existing on-line and/or sparse Gaussian process regression approaches.},

These anomalies are due to the presence of ferromagnetic material in the structure of buildings and in objects such as furniture. We represent the magnetic ﬁeld map using a Gaussian process model and take well-known physical properties of the magnetic ﬁeld into account. We build local maps using three-dimensional hexagonal block tiling. To make our approach computationally tractable we use reduced-rank Gaussian process regression in combination with a Rao–Blackwellised particle ﬁlter. We show that it is possible to obtain accurate position and orientation estimates using measurements from a smartphone, and that our approach provides a scalable magnetic ﬁeld {SLAM} algorithm in terms of both computational complexity and map storage.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a method to infer the terrain ﬁeld and robot position exploiting the vibration obtained from the interaction between terrain and mobile robot. In order for robot localization and mapping in unknown area, simultaneous localization and mapping ({SLAM}) technique is applied to map the surrounding area. In this case, when {SLAM} is performed using a ﬁeld such as {WiFi}, magnetic signal or terrain, a complete ﬁeld map should be inferred for the unexplored region as well as the explored one. Also the uncertainty should be indicated for the inferred ﬁeld, so that the ﬁeld map can be used as observation model for {SLAM}. Therefore, by modeling the observation model for the terrain ﬁeld with the Gaussian process, we estimate the observation probability distribution for the unknown regions. The inferred observation distribution can be used not only by ﬁeld maps, but also by efﬁcient path planning. We demonstrate the proposed method with the odometry of mobile robot navigating the testbed, and observations of terrain feature using simulation.},

	abstract = {The Gaussian process latent variable model ({GP}-{LVM}) provides a ﬂexible approach for non-linear dimensionality reduction that has been widely applied. However, the current approach for training {GP}-{LVMs} is based on maximum likelihood, where the latent projection variables are maximized over rather than integrated out. In this paper we present a Bayesian method for training {GP}-{LVMs} by introducing a non-standard variational inference framework that allows to approximately integrate out the latent variables and subsequently train a {GP}-{LVM} by maximizing an analytic lower bound on the exact marginal likelihood. We apply this method for learning a {GP}-{LVM} from iid observations and for learning non-linear dynamical systems where the observations are temporally correlated. We show that a beneﬁt of the variational Bayesian procedure is its robustness to overﬁtting and its ability to automatically select the dimensionality of the nonlinear latent space. The resulting framework is generic, ﬂexible and easy to extend for other purposes, such as Gaussian process regression with uncertain inputs and semi-supervised Gaussian processes. We demonstrate our method on synthetic data and standard machine learning benchmarks, as well as challenging real world datasets, including high resolution video data.},
